# Mobile-Games-AB-Testing---Cookie-Cats
The repository "Mobile Games AB Testing with Cookie Cats" contains the code and analysis for an AB-test performed on the popular mobile puzzle game Cookie Cats. Developed by Tactile Entertainment, the game features singing cats and requires players to connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and advance to the next level. The game includes gates that force players to either wait or make an in-app purchase to progress. The purpose of the AB-test was to determine the optimal placement of these gates to improve player retention. Specifically, we analyzed the impact of moving the first gate in the game from level 30 to level 40. This repository includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and data visualization to provide insights into the impact of the gate placement on player retention.
